In this movement, the elevation difference between the east and west of China has increased, the monsoon circulation has strengthened, and the natural geographical environment has undergone obvious regional differentiation: the Qinghai-Tibet uplift is the highest plateau in the world, and the tropical and subtropical environment in the Tertiary has been replaced by alpine desert; Northwest China is in a dry environment due to the increasing inland nature; The east becomes a humid monsoon area.

Because it is mainly determined by isotope technology, it is called isotope geological age, also known as absolute geological age. The criteria for determining the relative geological age are mainly as follows: The determination of the relative age is mainly based on three main aspects: the principle of overlapping of rock strata, the evolution law of biota and the cutting relationship between geological bodies (rock strata, rock masses, rock veins, etc.). (1) Stratigraphic sequence law: The original occurrence at the time of formation is generally horizontal or nearly horizontal, and the old strata formed first are always below, and the new strata formed later are covered above. This normal stratigraphic superposition relationship is the stratigraphic sequence law. (2) Fossil sequence law: the general trend of biological evolution is from simple to complex, from low to high; The biological types that have appeared in the past will never be repeated in the future evolution process. The former sentence reflects the stages of biological evolution, and the latter sentence reflects the irreversibility of biological evolution. This law is used to determine the relative geological age as follows: there are different palaeontofossil assemblages in the strata of different ages, and there are the same or similar paleontofossil assemblages in the strata of the same age; The simpler the form and structure of the fossil assemblage of paleontology is, the older the age of the stratum is, and vice versa, the newer it is, that is, the sequence law of the chemical stone layer. (3) The cutting law between geological bodies: newer geological bodies always cut or intersect older geological bodies, or the new ones are cut and the old ones are cut. The relative geological age of geology is determined by the interpenetration and cutting relationship between geological bodies. Relative geological age refers to the determination of the rocks formed in each geological history period and the biological assemblages contained in the rocks in order, showing the new and old relationship of rocks. Therefore, the relative age can only indicate the time of each geological event, and there is no absolute quantitative relationship.",

The Himalayan Mountains represent the Cenozoic orogeny in China. This movement has a significant impact on the geographical environment of Asia. In this movement, the elevation difference between the east and west of China has increased, the monsoon circulation has strengthened, and the natural geographical environment has undergone obvious regional differentiation: the Qinghai-Tibet uplift is the highest plateau in the world, and the tropical and subtropical environment in the Tertiary has been replaced by alpine desert; Northwest China is in a dry environment due to the increasing inland nature; The east becomes a humid monsoon area. It is generally believed that the Himalayan movement is divided into three episodes: the first episode occurred at the end of the Eocene and the beginning of the Oligocene, and the Qinghai-Tibet region became a land, thus turning into a denuded area; The second episode occurred in the Miocene, with a large crustal uplift, accompanied by large-scale faulting and magmatic activity; The third episode occurred at the end of the Pliocene and the beginning of the Pleistocene. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau as a whole rose strongly, forming a modern landscape pattern. The current altitude of all high mountains and plateaus in China is mainly the result of the rise since the third act of the Himalayan movement. In the regions on both sides of the Tropic of Cancer, there are deserts, known as the Tropic of Desert. The south of China just crosses the Tropic of Cancer, and deserts should also be distributed according to the convention. However, the high Qinghai-Tibet Plateau blocks the westerly circulation, strengthens the East Asian monsoon, brings abundant rain to the south of China, and makes the south of the Yangtze River green, known as the oasis of the Tropic of Cancer. In northern China, the northwest region is far from the sea and blocked by mountains, so it is difficult for the water vapor over the sea to reach there, so there is a large area of desert; North China is also relatively dry, and only the northeast is far away from the Himalayan orogeny and relatively close to the ocean, can it appear relatively wet.

This valley slope is steep, with a slope of more than 70 °. The narrowest part of the famous Tiger Leaping Gorge on the Jinsha River is only 30m, the steepest slope and valley can reach 70 °, and the depth of the canyon can reach 3000m (2) down-erosion groove: due to the large slope of the riverbed, the rapid flow, the down-erosion effect is very strong, often forming down-erosion groove. (3) Small waterfall: the rocks exposed in the active mountain area are mainly igneous and metamorphic rocks, with strong folds and developed fractures, which often form steep cliff landform in the mountain area. Waterfalls often appear at the steep cliff where the fault passes, or because of the difference in lithology between the two sides of the fault, the riverbed is in a stepped shape, and the water flows down from a high place, especially the Pi Lian sag, which is dominated by flying waterfalls or multiple or multi-level surface flow waterfalls. Once the waterfall is formed, the downward erosion is more intense, and the surface flow waterfall has a strong scouring erosion effect on the riverbed. At the place where the waterfall falls, the water splashes all over, eroding the rocks below and causing the upper rocks to collapse. The water flows down and hits in the direction, forming a deep pool under the action of gravity.

According to the different modes of relative motion between plates, plate boundaries can be divided into three types: (1) discrete plate boundaries refer to the axis of the ocean ridge, where the plates on both sides move against each other, the plate boundaries are separated by tension, and the asthenosphere materials are upwelling and condensed into a new ocean floor lithosphere. Therefore, discrete plate boundaries are also known as accretive or constructive plate boundaries. (2) Convergence type plate boundary, that is, the plate subduction zone near the trench or the collision zone between the continental plates. When the ocean and the continental plate converge, due to the high density and low position of the oceanic plate, the oceanic plate always subducts under the continental plate and forms a trench on the surface. When the oceanic plate continuously subducts under the continental plate and gradually disappears on the surface, The continental plate behind it may collide with other continental plates with similar density, resulting in strong tectonic deformation, magmatism and metamorphism, and forming mountains. At this time, the strong tectonic deformation zone formed is called plate collision zone (equivalent to the so-called orogenic zone before); It can also be divided into two sub-types: subduction boundary and collision boundary. After the disappearance of the ancient oceanic plate, the land blocks that were originally located on both sides of the oceanic plate healed up. The exposed line of the ancient subduction zone on the surface is called the suture line (or suture zone). ① Subduction boundary: the adjacent ocean and continental plate overlap each other, generally the ocean plate subducts below the continental plate, also known as the subduction zone. There are two secondary types: island arc - trench type, island arc developed above the subduction zone, mainly seen in the margin of the Northwest Pacific; Andean type (mountain arc trench type): the ocean plate subducts under the mountain arc along the continental margin trench, mainly seen in the western edge of the South American continent. ② Collision type boundary: collision zone or welding line between two continental plates (3) dislocation type plate boundary, namely, conversion fault, with horizontal shear slip of plates on both sides, usually without plate growth or plate death. The transform fault is generally distributed near the ocean ridge and sometimes extends to the continental margin, such as the San Andres fault in the western United States.

        "expected_output": "1、 The main points of the continental drift theory are as follows: (1). The continental system is composed of lighter rigid aluminosilicate, which floats on the heavier viscous magnesiosilicate. (2) The continents of the world were connected after the Paleozoic Carboniferous and became Pangaea. The vast ocean surrounding the Pangea has become the Pangea. (3) Under the action of tidal force and geostrophic centrifugal force, it began to drift towards the equator and west since the Mesozoic era. The pan-continent gradually ruptured, separated and drifted, forming the basic pattern of modern land and sea distribution. (4) In the process of drifting towards the equator and westward, the front edge of each continent is compressed and folded to form mountains, such as Cordillera and Andes. The rear edge falls off due to the adhesion and drag of the silicon and magnesium layer to form island arcs and islands, such as island arcs and islands in the eastern edge of the Asian continent. The Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the Arctic Ocean are formed in the process of continental drift, while the Pacific Ocean is the remnant of the Pan Ocean. 2、 The main arguments of the theory of continental drift: (1). The contour of the continental coastline on both sides of the Atlantic is similar (2). The strata are similar (3). The geological structure is connected (4). The paleontology is similar (3). The fatal flaw of the theory of continental drift: (1) Can the continent float? The melting point of granite is lower than that of basalt. If the ground temperature is high enough to melt the basalt rock and allow the continental drift, but the granite still remains solid and floating on it, it is against the laws of physics (2) Can the continent drift? That is, the driving mechanism. Wigner believes that the centrifugal force of the earth's rotation makes the continent move from high latitude to the equator, and the tidal force also makes it drift westward; However, the calculation results show that its driving force is several orders of magnitude smaller than that required, and it is impossible to drive the continental drift at all. (3) Other controversial issues, for example, if the continental drift started from the Mesozoic era, how did the folded mountains formed before the Paleozoic era? 4、 New evidence of the theory of continental drift: because many problems could not be explained, the theory of continental drift gradually declined in the 1930s. Since the 1950s, the research progress in paleomagnetism and marine geology has re-recognized the once silent theory of continental drift. (1) . Continent contour well spliced (2).

Generally speaking, temperature is the most important factor. With the increase of temperature, the activity of molecules or atoms in the rock increases, which creates the prerequisite for metamorphism, mainly causing recrystallization and the formation of new minerals. There are two functions of pressure. The static pressure is caused by the weight of the overlying material and increases with depth. Its function makes the temperature of metamorphic reaction rise and forms minerals with smaller molecular volume and larger specific gravity. The stress is a kind of directional pressure, which is related to tectonic movement. It is stronger in the shallow part of the crust and weaker in the deep part. In the shallow part of the earth's crust, the stress of crustal movement is the most concentrated, which mainly forms the changes in rock structure (mechanical transformation). In the depth of the earth's crust, chemical reactions between minerals are easy to occur due to the high temperature. Dissolve in the direction of maximum stress (pressure solution), precipitate in the direction of minimum stress, and form columnar and flaky minerals under the action of directional pressure.

The mode of marine erosion includes mechanical denudation and chemical dissolution, but mainly mechanical denudation. There are two kinds of mechanical denudation: one is that the rock is destroyed by the rock alluvial by the sea water in the process of movement, which is called erosion; One is that the gravel sand carried by the moving sea water rubs and collides with the coast or the seabed, causing it to be damaged, which is called abrasion. The main driving force of sea erosion is sea waves. In the coastal zone composed of bedrock, the sea waves violently wash the coast with the surf and abrade the seabed and coastal rocks of the coastal zone with the gravel sand it carries. Tide can promote the destructive effect of waves in the open coastal zone. Under the continuous destruction of waves and tides, a groove extending along the coast is formed near the height of the waves at the base of the shore wall, which is called the sea erosion groove. The sea erosion groove continues to expand and deepen, and the upper rock of the sea erosion groove loses its support and collapses, forming a straight and steep rock wall, called the sea erosion cliff. If the sea erosion cliff retreats continuously under the action of sea waves, a slightly seaward inclined platform composed of bedrock is formed in front of the sea erosion cliff, which is called the sea erosion platform (or wave cutting platform). The bottom current carries the material from the denuded coast to the sea side outside the wave cutting platform and deposits it to form the wave building platform. The bedrock column left on the wave cutting platform that has not been denuded is called marine erosion column. The sea erosion platform is continuously widened due to the sea erosion, so that the wave will pass more and more long distance when impacting the cliff foundation, and the energy consumption of the wave is increasing. Finally, all the energy of the sea wave is consumed on the sea erosion platform. The sea erosion tends to stop. After that, if the crust rises so that the wave cutting platform rises to the height that the sea water cannot submerge, the sea erosion terrace will be formed.",

        "expected_output": "American scholar N.L. Bowen (1922) found that the crystallization and precipitation of the main rock-forming minerals follow a certain sequence when the magma cools, and can be divided into two series, namely the continuous reaction series of plagioclase and the discontinuous reaction series of dark minerals, which is called Bowen reaction series. According to the different nature of the reaction, Bowen divided the main rock-forming minerals in the magmatic rocks into two reaction series. The continuous reaction series are frame-like aluminosilicate minerals with continuous gradual change in mineral composition, and there is no qualitative change in the internal crystal lattice. The discontinuous reaction series is Fe-Mg mineral, the change of mineral composition is discontinuous, and the internal crystal lattice has undergone qualitative change. If olivine becomes biotite, its crystalline framework changes from island to layer. In the process of magma crystallization of the above two series, the silica-aluminum minerals and ferromagnesium minerals have a co-junction relationship in turn, and the last two series evolved into a series, namely potassium feldspar, muscovite and quartz, which are the final products of magma crystallization. According to the above reaction series, the following practical problems can be solved: (1) Determine the crystallization order of minerals. The minerals in the upper part of the reaction series crystallized earlier than the minerals in the lower part. It is obvious that olivine and basic plagioclase are the earliest crystallization minerals, while quartz is the final product of magma crystallization. (2) The general law of mineral symbiosis and association in magmatic rocks is explained. Because the two reaction series have a co-junction relationship, when the magma cools to a certain temperature, it must crystallize a light-colored mineral and a dark mineral at the same time. For example, when the magma drops to 1550 ℃, olivine, orthopyroxene and basic (calcium, feldspar) feldspar are precipitated to form ultrabasic rocks. When the temperature of magma drops to 1270 ℃, clinopyroxene and feldspar precipitate simultaneously to form basic rocks. (3) The reasons for the diversity of magmatic rocks are explained. The same magma can form different types of magmatic rocks. (4) Some structural characteristics of magmatic rocks are explained.

According to the above principles, it is currently agreed that the classification of sandstone should reflect the following three issues: 1. the nature of the parent rock in the source area; 2. History of transportation and abrasion, i.e. rock maturity; 3. The physical condition of the medium at the time of deposition, namely the flow factor. Therefore, in terms of specific indicators, quartz, feldspar, rock debris and clay matrix in sandstone should be selected as the basis for classification. Because these variables are easy to identify and have genetic significance, the quantitative relationship between them can reflect the genetic characteristics of sandstone. The unstable clastic component can reflect the material source. Feldspar is the sign of granitic parent rock, while rock debris is the sign of volcanic, sedimentary and shallow metamorphic parent rock. The ratio of feldspar to cuttings (F/R, called source index) can reflect the basic characteristics of the parent rock association in the source area. The history of transportation and abrasion can be expressed by the relative volume ratio of stable and unstable components (i.e. Q/F+R, called mineral maturity). In general, the higher the mineral maturity, the better the abrasion condition and the longer the transportation history. The most widely distributed stable component in sandstone is quartz. The physical condition of the medium (density and viscosity) is an important factor that affects the mechanical deposition of clastic materials. The presence and quantity of clay matrix in sandstone is a specific indicator of the mechanical differentiation. This property of the medium can be expressed by the ratio of debris to matrix (i.e. C/M, called flow index). C/M ratio can directly reflect the degree of sand and mud mixing, that is, the quality of rock sorting. If the C/M ratio is very small, the sand and mud are mixed and the sorting is poor, indicating that the winnowing is not complete and the sediment accumulation speed is very fast",

        "expected_output": "A: American scholar N.L. Bowen (1922) found that the crystallization and precipitation of the main rock-forming minerals follow a certain sequence when the magma cools, which can be divided into two series, namely the continuous reaction series of plagioclase and the discontinuous reaction series of dark minerals, which is called Bowen reaction series. According to the different nature of the reaction, Bowen divided the main rock-forming minerals in the magmatic rocks into two reaction series. The continuous reaction series are frame-like aluminosilicate minerals with continuous gradual change in mineral composition, and there is no qualitative change in the internal crystal lattice. The discontinuous reaction series is Fe-Mg mineral, the change of mineral composition is discontinuous, and the internal crystal lattice has undergone qualitative change. If olivine becomes biotite, its crystalline framework changes from island to layer. In the process of magma crystallization of the above two series, the silica-aluminum minerals and ferromagnesium minerals have a co-junction relationship in turn, and the last two series evolved into a series, namely potassium feldspar, muscovite and quartz, which are the final products of magma crystallization. According to the above reaction series, the following practical problems can be solved: (1) Determine the crystallization order of minerals. The minerals in the upper part of the reaction series crystallized earlier than the minerals in the lower part. It is obvious that olivine and basic plagioclase are the earliest crystallization minerals, while quartz is the final product of magma crystallization. (2) The general law of mineral symbiosis and association in magmatic rocks is explained. Because the two reaction series have a co-junction relationship, when the magma cools to a certain temperature, it must crystallize a light-colored mineral and a dark mineral at the same time. For example, when the magma drops to 1550 ℃, olivine, orthopyroxene and basic (calcium, feldspar) feldspar are precipitated to form ultrabasic rocks. When the temperature of magma drops to 1270 ℃, clinopyroxene and feldspar precipitate simultaneously to form basic rocks. 9 (3) explains the reason for the diversity of magmatic rocks. The same magma can form different types of magmatic rocks. (4) Some structural characteristics of magmatic rocks are explained. Such as the normal ring structure of plagioclase and the reaction edge structure of dark minerals.",
        "actual_output": "The Bowen Reaction Series describes the order in which minerals crystallize from cooling magma.

        "expected_output": "A: Bedding is a layered structure formed by changes in mineral composition, color, texture and other characteristics along the vertical direction of the original sedimentary plane. Bedding is not only the basic structural feature of sedimentary rocks, but also a good indicator for studying sedimentary environment or sedimentary facies. The bedding is generally divided into the following types according to the morphological characteristics: 1. Horizontal bedding: the fine layers and the fine layers are parallel to each other and are mainly formed in the fine silt and argillaceous rocks, and are mostly found in the sediments formed in the environment of slow flow or advection, such as flood plain, oxbow lake, lagoon, swamp, and closed bay sediments. 2. Parallel bedding: similar to horizontal bedding, the fine layer and the interface between the fine layer and the layer system are also parallel to each other, but it occurs in the coarse-grained sandstone, often accompanied by scouring, which is formed under the conditions of rapid flow and shallow water flow. 3. Wavy bedding: the fine layer is wavy, but its general direction is parallel to each other and parallel to the layer plane. There are two kinds of causes. One is caused by the oscillating waves. The wave layer is symmetrical, and it is mainly seen in the sediments of shallow water zone, bay and lagoon environment; The other is caused by weak unidirectional flow, and the wave layer is asymmetric, which is mostly seen in the flood plain sediments. 4. Oblique bedding: the fine layer and the layer system interface are oblique, and the layer system can overlap and cross. It is the structural feature on the rock profile after the sand grain or sand wave formed in the current (or wind) is buried. The tendency of the fine layer reflects the flow direction (wind direction) of the medium, and the thickness of the fine layer (equivalent to the height of the sand ripple or sand wave) reflects the flow velocity of the medium. Therefore, oblique bedding is often used as an important indicator of flow dynamics (velocity, direction, depth, etc.) and sedimentary environment. The common ones are as follows: a. Plate-like oblique bedding: the fine layer is caused by unidirectional inclination and unidirectional flow, which can be seen in riverbed sediments. B. Trough cross bedding: on the cross section of the bedding, the interface of the layer system is grooved, and the curvature of the fine layer is consistent with the groove or intersects with it at a small angle; In the longitudinal section, the interface of the layer system is cut with each other in a gentle arc, and the fine layer is oblique to it. It is common in river sediments. C. Wedge bedding: the strata are wedge shaped, and mostly appear in the shallow water zone of delta, lake and sea. 5. Lenticular bedding: small sandy lenses are continuously and regularly wrapped in the argillaceous layer, and there is oblique bedding inside the sandstone lens. It is most common in tidal sediments. 6. Grain-order bedding: also known as progressive bedding, it has no obvious fine layer boundary. The whole bedding mainly shows the change of grain size, that is, the grain size gradually changes from coarse to fine from bottom to top. It is the sedimentary feature of turbidity current and is relatively common. 7. Massive bedding: the lithology of the rock layer is uniform from bottom to top, and other internal bedding structures can not be seen with the naked eye. The thickness is generally greater than lm, which is the product of rapid accumulation of sediments. It can also be caused by biological disturbance.",

        "expected_output": "Answer: When classifying rocks, we must first select the characteristics that can be objectively identified and most closely related to the genesis of rocks as the basis for classification; Secondly, we should consider that the classification scheme is suitable for both field work and indoor research. According to the above principles, it is currently agreed that the classification of sandstone should reflect the following three issues: 1. the nature of the parent rock in the source area; 2. History of transportation and abrasion, i.e. rock maturity; 103. Physical conditions of the medium during deposition, i.e. flow factors. Therefore, in terms of specific indicators, quartz, feldspar, rock debris and clay matrix in sandstone should be selected as the basis for classification. Because these variables are easy to identify and have genetic significance, the quantitative relationship between them can reflect the genetic characteristics of sandstone. The unstable clastic component can reflect the material source. Feldspar is the sign of granitic parent rock, while rock debris is the sign of volcanic, sedimentary and shallow metamorphic parent rock. The ratio of feldspar to cuttings (F/R, called source index) can reflect the basic characteristics of the parent rock association in the source area. The history of transportation and abrasion can be expressed by the relative volume ratio of stable and unstable components (i.e. Q/F+R, called mineral maturity). In general, the higher the mineral maturity, the better the abrasion condition and the longer the transportation history. The most widely distributed stable component in sandstone is quartz. The physical condition of the medium (density and viscosity) is an important factor that affects the mechanical deposition of clastic materials. The presence and quantity of clay matrix in sandstone is a specific indicator of the mechanical differentiation. This property of the medium can be expressed by the ratio of debris to matrix (i.e. C/M, called flow index). C/M ratio can directly reflect the degree of sand and mud mixing, that is, the quality of rock sorting. If the C/M ratio is very small, the sand and mud are mixed and the sorting is poor, indicating that the winnowing is not complete and the sediment accumulation speed is very fast. eleven",

On the other hand, it is a discontinuous reaction series of dark minerals (iron magnesium minerals), that is, crystallization in the order of olivine, pyroxene, hornblende and biotite; (2 ') During this series of evolution, there is not a continuous transition in composition between the adjacent minerals before and after, but a reaction between magma and early minerals to produce new minerals, and the crystal framework of adjacent minerals has also changed significantly. With the decrease of temperature, these two series synthesized a single discontinuous reaction series in the late stage of magma, crystallized potassium feldspar, muscovite in turn, and finally precipitated quartz. (2 ') Bowen reaction series, to a certain extent, explains the crystallization order and paragenetic association law of minerals in magma, and provides a simple method to master the classification of igneous rocks. The vertical line indicates the sequence of mineral crystallization from high temperature to low temperature; The horizontal line indicates that the minerals at the same horizontal position are basically crystallized at the same time and form certain types of rocks according to the symbiotic law. For example, pyroxene and calcium-rich plagioclase constitute basic rocks, which cannot be associated with quartz; (2 ') Potassium feldspar, sodium-rich plagioclase, quartz, biotite and other acidic rocks, which cannot be associated with olivine.
