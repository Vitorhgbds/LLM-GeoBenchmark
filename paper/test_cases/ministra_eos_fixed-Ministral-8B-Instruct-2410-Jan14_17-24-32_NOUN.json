Most of the halite pseudocrystals seen in the rocks are isolated and scattered crystals. It is speculated that the halite was not dried up in the whole basin when it was formed, but only occurred in some shallow water sections. The rock salt crystals are covered by sediments after growing, and dissolved due to the reduction of salinity of seawater. The remaining voids are filled with clay components, thus preserving the crystal form of rock salt, so it is called rock salt pseudo-crystal. The rocks are mainly fine-grained sediments, indicating that the terrain was flat at that time, representing the deposition of coastal or lakeside areas under dry climate conditions.
