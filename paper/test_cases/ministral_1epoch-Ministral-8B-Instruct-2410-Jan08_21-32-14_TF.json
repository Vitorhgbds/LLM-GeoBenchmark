This is because the more rounded a particle is, the more it has been transported and abraded by water or ice, which tends to round off sharp edges and corners, resulting in a more spherical shape. The sphericity of a particle is a measure of how close it is to a perfect sphere, and it is often used as an indicator of the degree of transport and abrasion that the particle has undergone. Therefore, particles with good roundness tend to have higher sphericity. However, it is important to note that other factors such as the composition and hardness of the rock can also affect the shape of detrital particles. So, while the"
