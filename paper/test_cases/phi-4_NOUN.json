Most of the halite pseudocrystals seen in the rocks are isolated and scattered crystals. It is speculated that the halite was not dried up in the whole basin when it was formed, but only occurred in some shallow water sections. The rock salt crystals are covered by sediments after growing, and dissolved due to the reduction of salinity of seawater. The remaining voids are filled with clay components, thus preserving the crystal form of rock salt, so it is called rock salt pseudo-crystal. The rocks are mainly fine-grained sediments, indicating that the terrain was flat at that time, representing the deposition of coastal or lakeside areas under dry climate conditions.

The dip is the angle at which the stratum inclines relative to the horizontal plane, measured perpendicular to the strike, and is expressed in degrees. Together, these parameters describe the geometric orientation of the stratum, which is crucial for geological mapping and analysis."

It is a geological structure typically formed due to extensional tectonic forces, where the crust is being pulled apart. Horsts are often associated with grabens, which are the lower blocks that have subsided between the faults. The elevation of a horst can vary significantly, depending on the geological context and the extent of tectonic activity. Horsts are commonly found in regions with significant crustal extension, such as rift valleys."

        "actual_output": "A graben is a geological feature characterized by a depressed block of the Earth's crust bordered by parallel faults. It forms when the crust is stretched and pulled apart, causing the central block to sink relative to the surrounding blocks. Grabens are typically associated with extensional tectonic settings and can vary in size from small rift valleys to large basins. They often contain sedimentary deposits that accumulate in the lowered area. The East African Rift is a well-known example of a graben system."

It represents a gap in the geological record, often marked by an angular discordance or a disconformity, where the layers above and below are not parallel. Unconformities can be identified by differences in rock types, fossil content, or structural features, and they are crucial for understanding the geological history and relative timing of events in an area. They are typically classified into types such as angular unconformities, disconformities, nonconformities, and paraconformities."

It is a logarithmic scale, typically measured using the Richter scale or the moment magnitude scale (Mw). Each whole number increase on the Richter scale represents a tenfold increase in measured amplitude and roughly 31.6 times more energy release. The moment magnitude scale is more accurate for large earthquakes and is calculated based on the seismic moment, which considers the fault area, average slip on the fault, and the rigidity of the rocks involved. Magnitudes are dimensionless numbers, and there is no upper limit to the magnitude scale."

This scale ranges from I (not felt) to XII (total destruction), with each level describing the severity of shaking and damage. Unlike magnitude, which quantifies the energy released at the earthquake's source, intensity varies across different locations depending on factors such as distance from the epicenter, local geology, and building structures."

The grade, tonnage, and mineralogy of the deposit are critical factors in determining its economic potential.
