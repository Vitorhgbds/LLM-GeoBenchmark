The mid-ocean ridge is the outlet of the rising mantle material. The rising mantle material condenses to form a new ocean crust, and pushes the first formed ocean floor to gradually expand symmetrically to both sides. The expansion of the seafloor at the mid-ocean ridge may cause the continents on both sides of the new ocean to gradually move away from each other, and may also cause the old oceanic crust to subduct and submerge along the Benioff zone (subduction zone) at the trench of the continental margin, and return to the mantle, thus completing the renewal of the old oceanic crust.",

This process is driven by the upwelling of magma from the mantle, which solidifies to form new crust as it cools.

Most of the halite pseudocrystals seen in the rocks are isolated and scattered crystals. It is speculated that the halite was not dried up in the whole basin when it was formed, but only occurred in some shallow water sections. The rock salt crystals are covered by sediments after growing, and dissolved due to the reduction of salinity of seawater. The remaining voids are filled with clay components, thus preserving the crystal form of rock salt, so it is called rock salt pseudo-crystal. The rocks are mainly fine-grained sediments, indicating that the terrain was flat at that time, representing the deposition of coastal or lakeside areas under dry climate conditions.
