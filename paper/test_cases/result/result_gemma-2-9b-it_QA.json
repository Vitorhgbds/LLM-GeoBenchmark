The Himalayan Mountains represent the Cenozoic orogeny in China. This movement has a significant impact on the geographical environment of Asia. In this movement, the elevation difference between the east and west of China has increased, the monsoon circulation has strengthened, and the natural geographical environment has undergone obvious regional differentiation: the Qinghai-Tibet uplift is the highest plateau in the world, and the tropical and subtropical environment in the Tertiary has been replaced by alpine desert; Northwest China is in a dry environment due to the increasing inland nature; The east becomes a humid monsoon area. It is generally believed that the Himalayan movement is divided into three episodes: the first episode occurred at the end of the Eocene and the beginning of the Oligocene, and the Qinghai-Tibet region became a land, thus turning into a denuded area; The second episode occurred in the Miocene, with a large crustal uplift, accompanied by large-scale faulting and magmatic activity; The third episode occurred at the end of the Pliocene and the beginning of the Pleistocene. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau as a whole rose strongly, forming a modern landscape pattern. The current altitude of all high mountains and plateaus in China is mainly the result of the rise since the third act of the Himalayan movement. In the regions on both sides of the Tropic of Cancer, there are deserts, known as the Tropic of Desert. The south of China just crosses the Tropic of Cancer, and deserts should also be distributed according to the convention. However, the high Qinghai-Tibet Plateau blocks the westerly circulation, strengthens the East Asian monsoon, brings abundant rain to the south of China, and makes the south of the Yangtze River green, known as the oasis of the Tropic of Cancer. In northern China, the northwest region is far from the sea and blocked by mountains, so it is difficult for the water vapor over the sea to reach there, so there is a large area of desert; North China is also relatively dry, and only the northeast is far away from the Himalayan orogeny and relatively close to the ocean, can it appear relatively wet.

Because it is mainly determined by isotope technology, it is called isotope geological age, also known as absolute geological age. The criteria for determining the relative geological age are mainly as follows: The determination of the relative age is mainly based on three main aspects: the principle of overlapping of rock strata, the evolution law of biota and the cutting relationship between geological bodies (rock strata, rock masses, rock veins, etc.). (1) Stratigraphic sequence law: The original occurrence at the time of formation is generally horizontal or nearly horizontal, and the old strata formed first are always below, and the new strata formed later are covered above. This normal stratigraphic superposition relationship is the stratigraphic sequence law. (2) Fossil sequence law: the general trend of biological evolution is from simple to complex, from low to high; The biological types that have appeared in the past will never be repeated in the future evolution process. The former sentence reflects the stages of biological evolution, and the latter sentence reflects the irreversibility of biological evolution. This law is used to determine the relative geological age as follows: there are different palaeontofossil assemblages in the strata of different ages, and there are the same or similar paleontofossil assemblages in the strata of the same age; The simpler the form and structure of the fossil assemblage of paleontology is, the older the age of the stratum is, and vice versa, the newer it is, that is, the sequence law of the chemical stone layer. (3) The cutting law between geological bodies: newer geological bodies always cut or intersect older geological bodies, or the new ones are cut and the old ones are cut. The relative geological age of geology is determined by the interpenetration and cutting relationship between geological bodies. Relative geological age refers to the determination of the rocks formed in each geological history period and the biological assemblages contained in the rocks in order, showing the new and old relationship of rocks.

Once the waterfall is formed, the downward erosion is more intense, and the surface flow waterfall has a strong scouring erosion effect on the riverbed.

In this movement, the elevation difference between the east and west of China has increased, the monsoon circulation has strengthened, and the natural geographical environment has undergone obvious regional differentiation: the Qinghai-Tibet uplift is the highest plateau in the world, and the tropical and subtropical environment in the Tertiary has been replaced by alpine desert; Northwest China is in a dry environment due to the increasing inland nature; The east becomes a humid monsoon area. It is generally believed that the Himalayan movement is divided into three episodes: the first episode occurred at the end of the Eocene and the beginning of the Oligocene, and the Qinghai-Tibet region became a land, thus turning into a denuded area; The second episode occurred in the Miocene, with a large crustal uplift, accompanied by large-scale faulting and magmatic activity; The third episode occurred at the end of the Pliocene and the beginning of the Pleistocene. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau as a whole rose strongly, forming a modern landscape pattern. The current altitude of all high mountains and plateaus in China is mainly the result of the rise since the third act of the Himalayan movement. In the regions on both sides of the Tropic of Cancer, there are deserts, known as the Tropic of Desert. The south of China just crosses the Tropic of Cancer, and deserts should also be distributed according to the convention. However, the high Qinghai-Tibet Plateau blocks the westerly circulation, strengthens the East Asian monsoon, brings abundant rain to the south of China, and makes the south of the Yangtze River green, known as the oasis of the Tropic of Cancer. In northern China, the northwest region is far from the sea and blocked by mountains, so it is difficult for the water vapor over the sea to reach there, so there is a large area of desert; North China is also relatively dry, and only the northeast is far away from the Himalayan orogeny and relatively close to the ocean, can it appear relatively wet.

According to the different modes of relative motion between plates, plate boundaries can be divided into three types: (1) discrete plate boundaries refer to the axis of the ocean ridge, where the plates on both sides move against each other, the plate boundaries are separated by tension, and the asthenosphere materials are upwelling and condensed into a new ocean floor lithosphere. Therefore, discrete plate boundaries are also known as accretive or constructive plate boundaries. (2) Convergence type plate boundary, that is, the plate subduction zone near the trench or the collision zone between the continental plates. When the ocean and the continental plate converge, due to the high density and low position of the oceanic plate, the oceanic plate always subducts under the continental plate and forms a trench on the surface. When the oceanic plate continuously subducts under the continental plate and gradually disappears on the surface, The continental plate behind it may collide with other continental plates with similar density, resulting in strong tectonic deformation, magmatism and metamorphism, and forming mountains. At this time, the strong tectonic deformation zone formed is called plate collision zone (equivalent to the so-called orogenic zone before); It can also be divided into two sub-types: subduction boundary and collision boundary. After the disappearance of the ancient oceanic plate, the land blocks that were originally located on both sides of the oceanic plate healed up. The exposed line of the ancient subduction zone on the surface is called the suture line (or suture zone). \u2460 Subduction boundary: the adjacent ocean and continental plate overlap each other, generally the ocean plate subducts below the continental plate, also known as the subduction zone. There are two secondary types: island arc - trench type, island arc developed above the subduction zone, mainly seen in the margin of the Northwest Pacific; Andean type (mountain arc trench type): the ocean plate subducts under the mountain arc along the continental margin trench, mainly seen in the western edge of the South American continent. \u2461 Collision type boundary: collision zone or welding line between two continental plates (3) dislocation type plate boundary, namely, conversion fault, with horizontal shear slip of plates on both sides, usually without plate growth or plate death. The transform fault is generally distributed near the ocean ridge and sometimes extends to the continental margin, such as the San Andres fault in the western United States.

The quantitative conclusion of the rise and fall amplitude can be drawn to a large extent by analyzing the thickness of the rock stratum. (2) Analysis of lithofacies: lithofacies can generally be divided into marine facies, continental facies and transitional facies (such as delta facies at the entrance to the sea). Lithofacies change with the development of time and the change of space conditions. The lateral (horizontal) lithofacies change of the same rock layer reflects the difference of sedimentary environment in different areas at the same time. The vertical (vertical plane direction) lithofacies change of the same rock layer reflects the change of sedimentary environment in different periods of the same area, and this change is often the result of tectonic movement. (3) Structural deformation: tectonic movement often changes the occurrence of strata, resulting in structural deformation such as folds and faults. (4) Stratigraphic contact relationship (crust decline causes sedimentation and rise causes denudation, so various contact relationships recorded by crustal movement in the rock stratum are also evidence of tectonic movement): A. Integrated contact: when the crust is in a relatively stable decline (or although it has risen, but does not rise out of the sea), a continuous sedimentary rock stratum is formed, the old rock stratum is deposited below, the new rock stratum is on top, and there is no lack of rock stratum, This relationship is called integrated contact. B. Unconformity contact (due to tectonic movement, sedimentation is often interrupted to form strata with discontinuous ages. This relationship is called unconformity contact): a. Parallel unconformity: it indicates that the sedimentary area has undergone significant up-and-down movement and the paleogeographic environment has undergone significant changes in a period of time; B.

Bowen (1922) found that the crystallization and precipitation of the main rock-forming minerals follow a certain sequence when the magma cools, and can be divided into two series, namely the continuous reaction series of plagioclase and the discontinuous reaction series of dark minerals, which is called Bowen reaction series. According to the different nature of the reaction, Bowen divided the main rock-forming minerals in the magmatic rocks into two reaction series. The continuous reaction series are frame-like aluminosilicate minerals with continuous gradual change in mineral composition, and there is no qualitative change in the internal crystal lattice. The discontinuous reaction series is Fe-Mg mineral, the change of mineral composition is discontinuous, and the internal crystal lattice has undergone qualitative change. If olivine becomes biotite, its crystalline framework changes from island to layer. In the process of magma crystallization of the above two series, the silica-aluminum minerals and ferromagnesium minerals have a co-junction relationship in turn, and the last two series evolved into a series, namely potassium feldspar, muscovite and quartz, which are the final products of magma crystallization. According to the above reaction series, the following practical problems can be solved: (1) Determine the crystallization order of minerals. The minerals in the upper part of the reaction series crystallized earlier than the minerals in the lower part. It is obvious that olivine and basic plagioclase are the earliest crystallization minerals, while quartz is the final product of magma crystallization. (2) The general law of mineral symbiosis and association in magmatic rocks is explained. Because the two reaction series have a co-junction relationship, when the magma cools to a certain temperature, it must crystallize a light-colored mineral and a dark mineral at the same time. For example, when the magma drops to 1550 \u2103, olivine, orthopyroxene and basic (calcium, feldspar) feldspar are precipitated to form ultrabasic rocks. When the temperature of magma drops to 1270 \u2103, clinopyroxene and feldspar precipitate simultaneously to form basic rocks. (3) The reasons for the diversity of magmatic rocks are explained. The same magma can form different types of magmatic rocks. (4) Some structural characteristics of magmatic rocks are explained.

In the metamorphic process, these factors do not exist in isolation, but often exist at the same time, coordinate and restrict each other, and play different roles under different circumstances, thus forming different characteristics of metamorphism. Generally speaking, temperature is the most important factor. With the increase of temperature, the activity of molecules or atoms in the rock increases, which creates the prerequisite for metamorphism, mainly causing recrystallization and the formation of new minerals. There are two functions of pressure. The static pressure is caused by the weight of the overlying material and increases with depth. Its function makes the temperature of metamorphic reaction rise and forms minerals with smaller molecular volume and larger specific gravity. The stress is a kind of directional pressure, which is related to tectonic movement. It is stronger in the shallow part of the crust and weaker in the deep part. In the shallow part of the earth's crust, the stress of crustal movement is the most concentrated, which mainly forms the changes in rock structure (mechanical transformation). In the depth of the earth's crust, chemical reactions between minerals are easy to occur due to the high temperature. Dissolve in the direction of maximum stress (pressure solution), precipitate in the direction of minimum stress, and form columnar and flaky minerals under the action of directional pressure. In the underground fluid, there are mainly H2O, CO2, F, Cl, B and other volatiles. It generally exists in intergranular pores and fractures of minerals. It may come from intergranular pores of protolith, dehydration of protolith minerals, or magma and deep crust. The function of fluid is to act as a solvent, promote the dissolution of components, increase the diffusion rate, and thus promote the recrystallization and metamorphism reaction.

The continental system is composed of lighter rigid aluminosilicate, which floats on the heavier viscous magnesiosilicate. (2) The continents of the world were connected after the Paleozoic Carboniferous and became Pangaea. The vast ocean surrounding the Pangea has become the Pangea. (3) Under the action of tidal force and geostrophic centrifugal force, it began to drift towards the equator and west since the Mesozoic era. The pan-continent gradually ruptured, separated and drifted, forming the basic pattern of modern land and sea distribution. (4) In the process of drifting towards the equator and westward, the front edge of each continent is compressed and folded to form mountains, such as Cordillera and Andes. The rear edge falls off due to the adhesion and drag of the silicon and magnesium layer to form island arcs and islands, such as island arcs and islands in the eastern edge of the Asian continent. The Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the Arctic Ocean are formed in the process of continental drift, while the Pacific Ocean is the remnant of the Pan Ocean. 2\u3001 The main arguments of the theory of continental drift: (1). The contour of the continental coastline on both sides of the Atlantic is similar (2). The strata are similar (3). The geological structure is connected (4). The paleontology is similar (3). The fatal flaw of the theory of continental drift: (1) Can the continent float? The melting point of granite is lower than that of basalt. If the ground temperature is high enough to melt the basalt rock and allow the continental drift, but the granite still remains solid and floating on it, it is against the laws of physics (2) Can the continent drift? That is, the driving mechanism. Wigner believes that the centrifugal force of the earth's rotation makes the continent move from high latitude to the equator, and the tidal force also makes it drift westward; However, the calculation results show that its driving force is several orders of magnitude smaller than that required, and it is impossible to drive the continental drift at all. (3) Other controversial issues, for example, if the continental drift started from the Mesozoic era, how did the folded mountains formed before the Paleozoic era? 4\u3001 New evidence of the theory of continental drift: because many problems could not be explained, the theory of continental drift gradually declined in the 1930s. Since the 1950s, the research progress in paleomagnetism and marine geology has re-recognized the once silent theory of continental drift. (1) . Continent contour well spliced (2).

According to the above principles, it is currently agreed that the classification of sandstone should reflect the following three issues: 1. the nature of the parent rock in the source area; 2. History of transportation and abrasion, i.e. rock maturity; 3. The physical condition of the medium at the time of deposition, namely the flow factor. Therefore, in terms of specific indicators, quartz, feldspar, rock debris and clay matrix in sandstone should be selected as the basis for classification.

The ratio of feldspar to cuttings (F/R, called source index) can reflect the basic characteristics of the parent rock association in the source area.

The mode of marine erosion includes mechanical denudation and chemical dissolution, but mainly mechanical denudation. There are two kinds of mechanical denudation: one is that the rock is destroyed by the rock alluvial by the sea water in the process of movement, which is called erosion; One is that the gravel sand carried by the moving sea water rubs and collides with the coast or the seabed, causing it to be damaged, which is called abrasion. The main driving force of sea erosion is sea waves. In the coastal zone composed of bedrock, the sea waves violently wash the coast with the surf and abrade the seabed and coastal rocks of the coastal zone with the gravel sand it carries. Tide can promote the destructive effect of waves in the open coastal zone. Under the continuous destruction of waves and tides, a groove extending along the coast is formed near the height of the waves at the base of the shore wall, which is called the sea erosion groove. The sea erosion groove continues to expand and deepen, and the upper rock of the sea erosion groove loses its support and collapses, forming a straight and steep rock wall, called the sea erosion cliff. If the sea erosion cliff retreats continuously under the action of sea waves, a slightly seaward inclined platform composed of bedrock is formed in front of the sea erosion cliff, which is called the sea erosion platform (or wave cutting platform). The bottom current carries the denuded coastal material 8 to the side of the sea water outside the wave cutting platform and deposits it to form the wave building platform. The bedrock column left on the wave cutting platform that has not been denuded is called marine erosion column. The sea erosion platform is continuously widened due to the sea erosion, so that the wave will pass more and more long distance when impacting the cliff foundation, and the energy consumption of the wave is increasing. Finally, all the energy of the sea wave is consumed on the sea erosion platform. The sea erosion tends to stop.

Bowen (1922) found that the crystallization and precipitation of the main rock-forming minerals follow a certain sequence when the magma cools, which can be divided into two series, namely the continuous reaction series of plagioclase and the discontinuous reaction series of dark minerals, which is called Bowen reaction series. According to the different nature of the reaction, Bowen divided the main rock-forming minerals in the magmatic rocks into two reaction series. The continuous reaction series are frame-like aluminosilicate minerals with continuous gradual change in mineral composition, and there is no qualitative change in the internal crystal lattice. The discontinuous reaction series is Fe-Mg mineral, the change of mineral composition is discontinuous, and the internal crystal lattice has undergone qualitative change. If olivine becomes biotite, its crystalline framework changes from island to layer. In the process of magma crystallization of the above two series, the silica-aluminum minerals and ferromagnesium minerals have a co-junction relationship in turn, and the last two series evolved into a series, namely potassium feldspar, muscovite and quartz, which are the final products of magma crystallization. According to the above reaction series, the following practical problems can be solved: (1) Determine the crystallization order of minerals. The minerals in the upper part of the reaction series crystallized earlier than the minerals in the lower part. It is obvious that olivine and basic plagioclase are the earliest crystallization minerals, while quartz is the final product of magma crystallization. (2) The general law of mineral symbiosis and association in magmatic rocks is explained. Because the two reaction series have a co-junction relationship, when the magma cools to a certain temperature, it must crystallize a light-colored mineral and a dark mineral at the same time. For example, when the magma drops to 1550 \u2103, olivine, orthopyroxene and basic (calcium, feldspar) feldspar are precipitated to form ultrabasic rocks.

The mode of marine erosion includes mechanical denudation and chemical dissolution, but mainly mechanical denudation. There are two kinds of mechanical denudation: one is that the rock is destroyed by the rock alluvial by the sea water in the process of movement, which is called erosion; One is that the gravel sand carried by the moving sea water rubs and collides with the coast or the seabed, causing it to be damaged, which is called abrasion. The main driving force of sea erosion is sea waves. In the coastal zone composed of bedrock, the sea waves violently wash the coast with the surf and abrade the seabed and coastal rocks of the coastal zone with the gravel sand it carries. Tide can promote the destructive effect of waves in the open coastal zone. Under the continuous destruction of waves and tides, a groove extending along the coast is formed near the height of the waves at the base of the shore wall, which is called the sea erosion groove. The sea erosion groove continues to expand and deepen, and the upper rock of the sea erosion groove loses its support and collapses, forming a straight and steep rock wall, called the sea erosion cliff. If the sea erosion cliff retreats continuously under the action of sea waves, a slightly seaward inclined platform composed of bedrock is formed in front of the sea erosion cliff, which is called the sea erosion platform (or wave cutting platform). The bottom current carries the material from the denuded coast to the sea side outside the wave cutting platform and deposits it to form the wave building platform. The bedrock column left on the wave cutting platform that has not been denuded is called marine erosion column. The sea erosion platform is continuously widened due to the sea erosion, so that the wave will pass more and more long distance when impacting the cliff foundation, and the energy consumption of the wave is increasing. Finally, all the energy of the sea wave is consumed on the sea erosion platform. The sea erosion tends to stop.

The influence factors and results of metamorphism are discussed.", "actualOutput": "**Question:** What are the primary factors influencing metamorphism and their resulting effects on rock texture and mineralogy? \n\n\n\n", "expectedOutput": "A: The main factors that affect and control the occurrence of metamorphism are temperature, pressure and chemically active fluids. In the metamorphic process, these factors do not exist in isolation, but often exist at the same time, coordinate and restrict each other, and play different roles under different circumstances, thus forming different characteristics of metamorphism. Generally speaking, temperature is the most important factor. With the increase of temperature, the activity of molecules or atoms in the rock increases, which creates the prerequisite for metamorphism, mainly causing recrystallization and the formation of new minerals. There are two functions of pressure. The static pressure is caused by the weight of the overlying material and increases with depth. Its function makes the temperature of metamorphic reaction rise and forms minerals with smaller molecular volume and larger specific gravity. The stress is a kind of directional pressure, which is related to tectonic movement. It is stronger in the shallow part of the crust and weaker in the deep part. In the shallow part of the earth's crust, the stress of crustal movement is the most concentrated, which mainly forms the changes in rock structure (mechanical transformation). In the depth of the earth's crust, chemical reactions between minerals are easy to occur due to the high temperature. Dissolve in the direction of maximum stress (pressure solution), precipitate in the direction of minimum stress, and form columnar and flaky minerals under the action of directional pressure. In the underground fluid, there are mainly H2O, CO2, F, Cl, B and other volatiles. It generally exists in intergranular pores and fractures of minerals. It may come from intergranular pores of protolith, dehydration of protolith minerals, or magma and deep crust. The function of fluid is to act as a solvent, promote the dissolution of components, increase the diffusion rate, and thus promote the recrystallization and metamorphism reaction. It can also participate in the metamorphism reaction as a component to form minerals without water or water. The aqueous solution is also an indispensable medium for substances to be brought in or out of the metasomatism. The above factors are not isolated, but coexisting, coordinated and constrained. Under different circumstances, certain factors play a leading role, and thus show different characteristics of metamorphism.", "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Bert Similarity Metric", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": 0.060936134308576584, "strictMode": false}, {"name": "Prompt Alignment", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The score is 0.00 because the LLM output fails to provide a concise definition of the specific geoscience question as requested, which is a significant deviation from the prompt instructions.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "gpt-4o-mini", "evaluationCost": 0.00017685, "verboseLogs": "Prompt Instructions:\n[\n    \"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

Bedding is not only the basic structural feature of sedimentary rocks, but also a good indicator for studying sedimentary environment or sedimentary facies. The bedding is generally divided into the following types according to the morphological characteristics: 1. Horizontal bedding: the fine layers and the fine layers are parallel to each other and are mainly formed in the fine silt and argillaceous rocks, and are mostly found in the sediments formed in the environment of slow flow or advection, such as flood plain, oxbow lake, lagoon, swamp, and closed bay sediments. 2. Parallel bedding: similar to horizontal bedding, the fine layer and the interface between the fine layer and the layer system are also parallel to each other, but it occurs in the coarse-grained sandstone, often accompanied by scouring, which is formed under the conditions of rapid flow and shallow water flow. 3. Wavy bedding: the fine layer is wavy, but its general direction is parallel to each other and parallel to the layer plane. There are two kinds of causes. One is caused by the oscillating waves. The wave layer is symmetrical, and it is mainly seen in the sediments of shallow water zone, bay and lagoon environment; The other is caused by weak unidirectional flow, and the wave layer is asymmetric, which is mostly seen in the flood plain sediments. 4. Oblique bedding: the fine layer and the layer system interface are oblique, and the layer system can overlap and cross. It is the structural feature on the rock profile after the sand grain or sand wave formed in the current (or wind) is buried. The tendency of the fine layer reflects the flow direction (wind direction) of the medium, and the thickness of the fine layer (equivalent to the height of the sand ripple or sand wave) reflects the flow velocity of the medium. Therefore, oblique bedding is often used as an important indicator of flow dynamics (velocity, direction, depth, etc.) and sedimentary environment. The common ones are as follows: a. Plate-like oblique bedding: the fine layer is caused by unidirectional inclination and unidirectional flow, which can be seen in riverbed sediments. B. Trough cross bedding: on the cross section of the bedding, the interface of the layer system is grooved, and the curvature of the fine layer is consistent with the groove or intersects with it at a small angle; In the longitudinal section, the interface of the layer system is cut with each other in a gentle arc, and the fine layer is oblique to it. It is common in river sediments. C. Wedge bedding: the strata are wedge shaped, and mostly appear in the shallow water zone of delta, lake and sea. 5. Lenticular bedding: small sandy lenses are continuously and regularly wrapped in the argillaceous layer, and there is oblique bedding inside the sandstone lens. It is most common in tidal sediments. 6. Grain-order bedding: also known as progressive bedding, it has no obvious fine layer boundary. The whole bedding mainly shows the change of grain size, that is, the grain size gradually changes from coarse to fine from bottom to top. It is the sedimentary feature of turbidity current and is relatively common. 7. Massive bedding: the lithology of the rock layer is uniform from bottom to top, and other internal bedding structures can not be seen with the naked eye. The thickness is generally greater than lm, which is the product of rapid accumulation of sediments. It can also be caused by biological disturbance.", "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Bert Similarity Metric", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": 0.16368962824344635, "strictMode": false}, {"name": "Prompt Alignment", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The score is 0.00 because the output fails to provide a concise definition and lacks relevant numerical details for the main types of bedding structures, which are essential for a complete response.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "gpt-4o-mini", "evaluationCost": 0.00021779999999999998, "verboseLogs": "Prompt Instructions:\n[\n    \"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.
