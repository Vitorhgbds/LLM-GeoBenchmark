The main criteria for determining the relative geological age are the order of occurrence of rocks and fossils, the presence of fossils in rocks, and the presence of sedimentary structures.", "expectedOutput": "Geological age refers to the age of various geological events on the earth, which includes two meanings: one is the sequence of geological events, which is called relative geological age; The second refers to the present age of each geological event. Because it is mainly determined by isotope technology, it is called isotope geological age, also known as absolute geological age. The criteria for determining the relative geological age are mainly as follows: The determination of the relative age is mainly based on three main aspects: the principle of overlapping of rock strata, the evolution law of biota and the cutting relationship between geological bodies (rock strata, rock masses, rock veins, etc.). (1) Stratigraphic sequence law: The original occurrence at the time of formation is generally horizontal or nearly horizontal, and the old strata formed first are always below, and the new strata formed later are covered above. This normal stratigraphic superposition relationship is the stratigraphic sequence law. (2) Fossil sequence law: the general trend of biological evolution is from simple to complex, from low to high; The biological types that have appeared in the past will never be repeated in the future evolution process. The former sentence reflects the stages of biological evolution, and the latter sentence reflects the irreversibility of biological evolution. This law is used to determine the relative geological age as follows: there are different palaeontofossil assemblages in the strata of different ages, and there are the same or similar paleontofossil assemblages in the strata of the same age; The simpler the form and structure of the fossil assemblage of paleontology is, the older the age of the stratum is, and vice versa, the newer it is, that is, the sequence law of the chemical stone layer. (3) The cutting law between geological bodies: newer geological bodies always cut or intersect older geological bodies, or the new ones are cut and the old ones are cut. The relative geological age of geology is determined by the interpenetration and cutting relationship between geological bodies. Relative geological age refers to the determination of the rocks formed in each geological history period and the biological assemblages contained in the rocks in order, showing the new and old relationship of rocks. Therefore, the relative age can only indicate the time of each geological event, and there is no absolute quantitative relationship.", "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Bert Similarity Metric", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": 0.1565306931734085, "strictMode": false}, {"name": "Prompt Alignment", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The score is 0.00 because the LLM's response lacks the concise definition requested in the prompt, providing a more detailed explanation instead.

(3) Small waterfall: the rocks exposed in the active mountain area are mainly igneous and metamorphic rocks, with strong folds and developed fractures, which often form steep cliff landform in the mountain area. Waterfalls often appear at the steep cliff where the fault passes, or because of the difference in lithology between the two sides of the fault, the riverbed is in a stepped shape, and the water flows down from a high place, especially the Pi Lian sag, which is dominated by flying waterfalls or multiple or multi-level surface flow waterfalls. Once the waterfall is formed, the downward erosion is more intense, and the surface flow waterfall has a strong scouring erosion effect on the riverbed. At the place where the waterfall falls, the water splashes all over, eroding the rocks below and causing the upper rocks to collapse. The water flows down and hits in the direction, forming a deep pool under the action of gravity.

According to the different modes of relative motion between plates, plate boundaries can be divided into three types: (1) discrete plate boundaries refer to the axis of the ocean ridge, where the plates on both sides move against each other, the plate boundaries are separated by tension, and the asthenosphere materials are upwelling and condensed into a new ocean floor lithosphere. Therefore, discrete plate boundaries are also known as accretive or constructive plate boundaries. (2) Convergence type plate boundary, that is, the plate subduction zone near the trench or the collision zone between the continental plates. When the ocean and the continental plate converge, due to the high density and low position of the oceanic plate, the oceanic plate always subducts under the continental plate and forms a trench on the surface. When the oceanic plate continuously subducts under the continental plate and gradually disappears on the surface, The continental plate behind it may collide with other continental plates with similar density, resulting in strong tectonic deformation, magmatism and metamorphism, and forming mountains. At this time, the strong tectonic deformation zone formed is called plate collision zone (equivalent to the so-called orogenic zone before); It can also be divided into two sub-types: subduction boundary and collision boundary. After the disappearance of the ancient oceanic plate, the land blocks that were originally located on both sides of the oceanic plate healed up. The exposed line of the ancient subduction zone on the surface is called the suture line (or suture zone). \u2460 Subduction boundary: the adjacent ocean and continental plate overlap each other, generally the ocean plate subducts below the continental plate, also known as the subduction zone. There are two secondary types: island arc - trench type, island arc developed above the subduction zone, mainly seen in the margin of the Northwest Pacific; Andean type (mountain arc trench type): the ocean plate subducts under the mountain arc along the continental margin trench, mainly seen in the western edge of the South American continent. \u2461 Collision type boundary: collision zone or welding line between two continental plates (3) dislocation type plate boundary, namely, conversion fault, with horizontal shear slip of plates on both sides, usually without plate growth or plate death. The transform fault is generally distributed near the ocean ridge and sometimes extends to the continental margin, such as the San Andres fault in the western United States.

(2) Parallel unconformity, also known as pseudo-conformity, refers to the overlapping of two sets of strata with basically the same occurrence, but the age is discontinuous, and the sediments (or strata) of some ages are missing. This contact relationship indicates that there has been lifting movement during this period, and the land has been eroded, resulting in uneven erosion surface between the two sets of strata, which is called unconformity surface. The era of missing strata is the period of crustal rise. Parallel unconformity reflects the ascending and descending movement of the earth's crust, and the ascending and descending movement will cause the changes of sea and land, so it can also be said that parallel unconformity reflects the land-forming movement. Angular unconformity: refers to the contact between two sets of strata that are not parallel to each other, and the strata age is not continuous, and there are strata missing between them (the sediments have been interrupted), which indicates that before the formation of the second set of strata, there has been horizontal compression movement and upward movement, so that the upper and lower sets of strata are in angular contact.

During the process of rising and moving, the composition of magma changes continuously due to the change of physical and chemical conditions, and finally condenses into rock. This is a complex process. The rock formed is magmatic rock. Sandstone is formed by sedimentation, which refers to the accumulation of materials transported by various agents in new places under the reduction of medium kinetic energy or change of physical and chemical conditions and biological action. Gneiss is formed by metamorphism, which refers to the geological process of forming new rocks due to the change of physical and chemical conditions in the specific geological conditions and environment underground, which makes the original rocks change in material composition, structure and structure basically in solid state. Sedimentation is caused by external geological processes, which are mainly caused by external energy sources of the earth and occur on the surface of the earth.

The top and bottom boundaries of the segment should also be obvious, generally marked by obvious conformity boundaries; Stratum: The smallest lithostratigraphic unit. There are two types: one is the combination of rock strata with the same or similar lithology, or the combination of basic sequences with the same structure, which can be used for layering in field profile research; The second is the rock or ore layer with special lithology and obvious signs, which can be used as the sign layer or the special layer for regional geological mapping.", "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Bert Similarity Metric", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": 0.1184513121843338, "strictMode": false}, {"name": "Prompt Alignment", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The score is 0.00 because the LLM failed to deliver a concise definition as requested, opting instead for a lengthy explanation without including relevant numerical details or technical specifications.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "gpt-4o-mini", "evaluationCost": 0.00020924999999999996, "verboseLogs": "Prompt Instructions:\n[\n    \"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

Special geological records such as ophiolite suite, melange accumulation and high-pressure metamorphic belt are distributed intermittently along the suture line; Identification of the ancient continental margin: the continental margin between the plate suture and the continental plate is the part of the continental margin of the plate, which is different from both the stable cratonic basin within the continental plate and the sedimentary and structural characteristics of the oceanic basin; Paleomagnetic method: Through demagnetization technology, the magnetization direction at the time of rock formation can be restored, and the paleolatitude can be calculated. According to the location of the sampling points, the paleolatitude of the ancient plate at that time can be determined. Through the analysis of the paleomagnetic paleolatitude of the same plate at different times, the movement direction and distance of the plate can be deduced. The position of the ancient magnetic pole can also be calculated through the paleomagnetic research, and then the orientation of the ancient plate can be restored according to the magnetic declination and the ancient magnetic pole.

Lithofacies change with the development of time and the change of space conditions. The lateral (horizontal) lithofacies change of the same rock layer reflects the difference of sedimentary environment in different areas at the same time. The vertical (vertical plane direction) lithofacies change of the same rock layer reflects the change of sedimentary environment in different periods of the same area, and this change is often the result of tectonic movement. (3) Structural deformation: tectonic movement often changes the occurrence of strata, resulting in structural deformation such as folds and faults. (4) Stratigraphic contact relationship (crust decline causes sedimentation and rise causes denudation, so various contact relationships recorded by crustal movement in the rock stratum are also evidence of tectonic movement): A. Integrated contact: when the crust is in a relatively stable decline (or although it has risen, but does not rise out of the sea), a continuous sedimentary rock stratum is formed, the old rock stratum is deposited below, the new rock stratum is on top, and there is no lack of rock stratum, This relationship is called integrated contact. B. Unconformity contact (due to tectonic movement, sedimentation is often interrupted to form strata with discontinuous ages. This relationship is called unconformity contact): a. Parallel unconformity: it indicates that the sedimentary area has undergone significant up-and-down movement and the paleogeographic environment has undergone significant changes in a period of time; B.

In the metamorphic process, these factors do not exist in isolation, but often exist at the same time, coordinate and restrict each other, and play different roles under different circumstances, thus forming different characteristics of metamorphism. Generally speaking, temperature is the most important factor. With the increase of temperature, the activity of molecules or atoms in the rock increases, which creates the prerequisite for metamorphism, mainly causing recrystallization and the formation of new minerals. There are two functions of pressure. The static pressure is caused by the weight of the overlying material and increases with depth. Its function makes the temperature of metamorphic reaction rise and forms minerals with smaller molecular volume and larger specific gravity. The stress is a kind of directional pressure, which is related to tectonic movement. It is stronger in the shallow part of the crust and weaker in the deep part. In the shallow part of the earth's crust, the stress of crustal movement is the most concentrated, which mainly forms the changes in rock structure (mechanical transformation). In the depth of the earth's crust, chemical reactions between minerals are easy to occur due to the high temperature. Dissolve in the direction of maximum stress (pressure solution), precipitate in the direction of minimum stress, and form columnar and flaky minerals under the action of directional pressure. In the underground fluid, there are mainly H2O, CO2, F, Cl, B and other volatiles. It generally exists in intergranular pores and fractures of minerals. It may come from intergranular pores of protolith, dehydration of protolith minerals, or magma and deep crust. The function of fluid is to act as a solvent, promote the dissolution of components, increase the diffusion rate, and thus promote the recrystallization and metamorphism reaction. It can also participate in the metamorphism reaction as a component to form minerals without water or water. The aqueous solution is also an indispensable medium for substances to be brought in or out of the metasomatism. The above factors are not isolated, but coexisting, coordinated and constrained.

This paper discusses the basis for the classification of sandstone composition and explains why this is the basis for classification.", "actualOutput": "The classification of sandstone composition is based on the type and proportion of minerals present in the rock.", "expectedOutput": "Answer: When classifying rocks, we must first select the characteristics that can be objectively identified and most closely related to the genesis of rocks as the basis for classification; Secondly, we should consider that the classification scheme is suitable for both field work and indoor research. According to the above principles, it is currently agreed that the classification of sandstone should reflect the following three issues: 1. the nature of the parent rock in the source area; 2. History of transportation and abrasion, i.e. rock maturity; 103. Physical conditions of the medium during deposition, i.e. flow factors. Therefore, in terms of specific indicators, quartz, feldspar, rock debris and clay matrix in sandstone should be selected as the basis for classification. Because these variables are easy to identify and have genetic significance, the quantitative relationship between them can reflect the genetic characteristics of sandstone. The unstable clastic component can reflect the material source. Feldspar is the sign of granitic parent rock, while rock debris is the sign of volcanic, sedimentary and shallow metamorphic parent rock. The ratio of feldspar to cuttings (F/R, called source index) can reflect the basic characteristics of the parent rock association in the source area. The history of transportation and abrasion can be expressed by the relative volume ratio of stable and unstable components (i.e. Q/F+R, called mineral maturity). In general, the higher the mineral maturity, the better the abrasion condition and the longer the transportation history. The most widely distributed stable component in sandstone is quartz. The physical condition of the medium (density and viscosity) is an important factor that affects the mechanical deposition of clastic materials. The presence and quantity of clay matrix in sandstone is a specific indicator of the mechanical differentiation. This property of the medium can be expressed by the ratio of debris to matrix (i.e. C/M, called flow index). C/M ratio can directly reflect the degree of sand and mud mixing, that is, the quality of rock sorting. If the C/M ratio is very small, the sand and mud are mixed and the sorting is poor, indicating that the winnowing is not complete and the sediment accumulation speed is very fast. eleven", "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Bert Similarity Metric", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": 0.06683387607336044, "strictMode": false}, {"name": "Prompt Alignment", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The score is 0.00 because the LLM output fails to provide the necessary details and explanations about the basis for classification, as requested in the prompt.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "gpt-4o-mini", "evaluationCost": 0.00017624999999999997, "verboseLogs": "Prompt Instructions:\n[\n    \"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

The continental system is composed of lighter rigid aluminosilicate, which floats on the heavier viscous magnesiosilicate. (2) The continents of the world were connected after the Paleozoic Carboniferous and became Pangaea. The vast ocean surrounding the Pangea has become the Pangea. (3) Under the action of tidal force and geostrophic centrifugal force, it began to drift towards the equator and west since the Mesozoic era. The pan-continent gradually ruptured, separated and drifted, forming the basic pattern of modern land and sea distribution. (4) In the process of drifting towards the equator and westward, the front edge of each continent is compressed and folded to form mountains, such as Cordillera and Andes. The rear edge falls off due to the adhesion and drag of the silicon and magnesium layer to form island arcs and islands, such as island arcs and islands in the eastern edge of the Asian continent. The Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the Arctic Ocean are formed in the process of continental drift, while the Pacific Ocean is the remnant of the Pan Ocean. 2\u3001 The main arguments of the theory of continental drift: (1). The contour of the continental coastline on both sides of the Atlantic is similar (2). The strata are similar (3). The geological structure is connected (4). The paleontology is similar (3). The fatal flaw of the theory of continental drift: (1) Can the continent float? The melting point of granite is lower than that of basalt. If the ground temperature is high enough to melt the basalt rock and allow the continental drift, but the granite still remains solid and floating on it, it is against the laws of physics (2) Can the continent drift? That is, the driving mechanism. Wigner believes that the centrifugal force of the earth's rotation makes the continent move from high latitude to the equator, and the tidal force also makes it drift westward; However, the calculation results show that its driving force is several orders of magnitude smaller than that required, and it is impossible to drive the continental drift at all. (3) Other controversial issues, for example, if the continental drift started from the Mesozoic era, how did the folded mountains formed before the Paleozoic era? 4\u3001 New evidence of the theory of continental drift: because many problems could not be explained, the theory of continental drift gradually declined in the 1930s. Since the 1950s, the research progress in paleomagnetism and marine geology has re-recognized the once silent theory of continental drift. (1) . Continent contour well spliced (2).

According to the above principles, it is currently agreed that the classification of sandstone should reflect the following three issues: 1. the nature of the parent rock in the source area; 2. History of transportation and abrasion, i.e. rock maturity; 3. The physical condition of the medium at the time of deposition, namely the flow factor. Therefore, in terms of specific indicators, quartz, feldspar, rock debris and clay matrix in sandstone should be selected as the basis for classification. Because these variables are easy to identify and have genetic significance, the quantitative relationship between them can reflect the genetic characteristics of sandstone. The unstable clastic component can reflect the material source. Feldspar is the sign of granitic parent rock, while rock debris is the sign of volcanic, sedimentary and shallow metamorphic parent rock. The ratio of feldspar to cuttings (F/R, called source index) can reflect the basic characteristics of the parent rock association in the source area. The history of transportation and abrasion can be expressed by the relative volume ratio of stable and unstable components (i.e. Q/F+R, called mineral maturity). In general, the higher the mineral maturity, the better the abrasion condition and the longer the transportation history. The most widely distributed stable component in sandstone is quartz. The physical condition of the medium (density and viscosity) is an important factor that affects the mechanical deposition of clastic materials. The presence and quantity of clay matrix in sandstone is a specific indicator of the mechanical differentiation. This property of the medium can be expressed by the ratio of debris to matrix (i.e. C/M, called flow index). C/M ratio can directly reflect the degree of sand and mud mixing, that is, the quality of rock sorting. If the C/M ratio is very small, the sand and mud are mixed and the sorting is poor, indicating that the winnowing is not complete and the sediment accumulation speed is very fast", "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Bert Similarity Metric", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": -0.08287430554628372, "strictMode": false}, {"name": "Prompt Alignment", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The score is 0.00 because the LLM fails to provide the necessary technical specifications and relevant details regarding sandstone classification as instructed.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "gpt-4o-mini", "evaluationCost": 0.00017099999999999998, "verboseLogs": "Prompt Instructions:\n[\n    \"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

The influence factors and results of metamorphism are discussed.", "actualOutput": "Metamorphism is the process of changing the physical and chemical properties of a rock due to exposure to heat, pressure, and chemically active fluids. It can result in the formation of new minerals and textures, and can cause rocks to become more or less dense, harder, or more resistant to weathering.", "expectedOutput": "A: The main factors that affect and control the occurrence of metamorphism are temperature, pressure and chemically active fluids. In the metamorphic process, these factors do not exist in isolation, but often exist at the same time, coordinate and restrict each other, and play different roles under different circumstances, thus forming different characteristics of metamorphism. Generally speaking, temperature is the most important factor. With the increase of temperature, the activity of molecules or atoms in the rock increases, which creates the prerequisite for metamorphism, mainly causing recrystallization and the formation of new minerals. There are two functions of pressure. The static pressure is caused by the weight of the overlying material and increases with depth. Its function makes the temperature of metamorphic reaction rise and forms minerals with smaller molecular volume and larger specific gravity. The stress is a kind of directional pressure, which is related to tectonic movement. It is stronger in the shallow part of the crust and weaker in the deep part. In the shallow part of the earth's crust, the stress of crustal movement is the most concentrated, which mainly forms the changes in rock structure (mechanical transformation). In the depth of the earth's crust, chemical reactions between minerals are easy to occur due to the high temperature. Dissolve in the direction of maximum stress (pressure solution), precipitate in the direction of minimum stress, and form columnar and flaky minerals under the action of directional pressure. In the underground fluid, there are mainly H2O, CO2, F, Cl, B and other volatiles. It generally exists in intergranular pores and fractures of minerals. It may come from intergranular pores of protolith, dehydration of protolith minerals, or magma and deep crust. The function of fluid is to act as a solvent, promote the dissolution of components, increase the diffusion rate, and thus promote the recrystallization and metamorphism reaction. It can also participate in the metamorphism reaction as a component to form minerals without water or water. The aqueous solution is also an indispensable medium for substances to be brought in or out of the metasomatism. The above factors are not isolated, but coexisting, coordinated and constrained.

The main types of bedding structures of sedimentary rocks are listed and explained.", "actualOutput": "The main types of bedding structures of sedimentary rocks are parallel, cross, and wavy.", "expectedOutput": "A: Bedding is a layered structure formed by changes in mineral composition, color, texture and other characteristics along the vertical direction of the original sedimentary plane. Bedding is not only the basic structural feature of sedimentary rocks, but also a good indicator for studying sedimentary environment or sedimentary facies. The bedding is generally divided into the following types according to the morphological characteristics: 1. Horizontal bedding: the fine layers and the fine layers are parallel to each other and are mainly formed in the fine silt and argillaceous rocks, and are mostly found in the sediments formed in the environment of slow flow or advection, such as flood plain, oxbow lake, lagoon, swamp, and closed bay sediments. 2. Parallel bedding: similar to horizontal bedding, the fine layer and the interface between the fine layer and the layer system are also parallel to each other, but it occurs in the coarse-grained sandstone, often accompanied by scouring, which is formed under the conditions of rapid flow and shallow water flow. 3. Wavy bedding: the fine layer is wavy, but its general direction is parallel to each other and parallel to the layer plane. There are two kinds of causes. One is caused by the oscillating waves. The wave layer is symmetrical, and it is mainly seen in the sediments of shallow water zone, bay and lagoon environment; The other is caused by weak unidirectional flow, and the wave layer is asymmetric, which is mostly seen in the flood plain sediments. 4. Oblique bedding: the fine layer and the layer system interface are oblique, and the layer system can overlap and cross. It is the structural feature on the rock profile after the sand grain or sand wave formed in the current (or wind) is buried. The tendency of the fine layer reflects the flow direction (wind direction) of the medium, and the thickness of the fine layer (equivalent to the height of the sand ripple or sand wave) reflects the flow velocity of the medium. Therefore, oblique bedding is often used as an important indicator of flow dynamics (velocity, direction, depth, etc.) and sedimentary environment. The common ones are as follows: a. Plate-like oblique bedding: the fine layer is caused by unidirectional inclination and unidirectional flow, which can be seen in riverbed sediments. B. Trough cross bedding: on the cross section of the bedding, the interface of the layer system is grooved, and the curvature of the fine layer is consistent with the groove or intersects with it at a small angle; In the longitudinal section, the interface of the layer system is cut with each other in a gentle arc, and the fine layer is oblique to it. It is common in river sediments. C. Wedge bedding: the strata are wedge shaped, and mostly appear in the shallow water zone of delta, lake and sea. 5. Lenticular bedding: small sandy lenses are continuously and regularly wrapped in the argillaceous layer, and there is oblique bedding inside the sandstone lens. It is most common in tidal sediments. 6. Grain-order bedding: also known as progressive bedding, it has no obvious fine layer boundary. The whole bedding mainly shows the change of grain size, that is, the grain size gradually changes from coarse to fine from bottom to top. It is the sedimentary feature of turbidity current and is relatively common. 7. Massive bedding: the lithology of the rock layer is uniform from bottom to top, and other internal bedding structures can not be seen with the naked eye.

Water does not participate in the crystal composition and has nothing to do with the mineral crystal structure. Crystalline water: participates in the formation of mineral crystal structure in the form of neutral water molecules. The quantity of water is fixed and complies with the law of constant ratio. Due to the lattice binding, the loss temperature is high, about 200~500 \u2103, or even higher. After the loss, the structure is destroyed. Structural water (or combined water): It forms mineral crystal structure in the form of OH - or H+, H3O+ions, so it also has a certain content ratio. The bonding strength is higher, and the loss temperature is 500~900 \u2103, and H2O is released. Zeolite water: There are large cavities and channels in the crystal structure of zeolite minerals, in which H2O exists, occupying a certain position, with a certain upper limit of content, and will not damage the structure after escaping with the change of temperature. Interlayer water: the neutral water molecules existing between the structural units of layered silicate minerals, such as the interlayer water of montmorillonite, have variable content, water escape, and the structure is not damaged, but the interlayer spacing of adjacent structural units is reduced, and when there is water, it can be re-absorbed and expanded.", "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Bert Similarity Metric", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": -0.007122456096112728, "strictMode": false}, {"name": "Prompt Alignment", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The score is 0.00 because the LLM response fails to provide a concise definition as requested in the prompt, instead listing numerous types of water without a clear and focused explanation.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "gpt-4o-mini", "evaluationCost": 0.00021719999999999997, "verboseLogs": "Prompt Instructions:\n[\n    \"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.
