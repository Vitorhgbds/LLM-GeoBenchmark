As the ocean basin widens, it eventually reaches a maximum size, after which it begins to close as the oceanic crust is subducted beneath the continental crust. This leads to the formation of a mountain range and the eventual collision of the two continents. The cycle then repeats itself, with the formation of a new ocean basin and the opening of a new rift.
